    "### What is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the `Python interpreter`, `libraries` and `scripts` installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a `directory tree` which contains Python executable files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common installation tools such as `setuptools` and `pip` work as expected with virtual environments. In other words, when a virtual environment is `active` (i.e., the virtual environment’s `Python interpreter is running`), they install Python packages into the virtual environment without needing to be told to do so explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a python Interpreter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an Interpretive language. `Interpreter` executes the code line by line and show the output until any error occurs otherwise executes complete code successfully. Choice of the interpretor is almost the same thing as choosing between an `Environment`, for the context of getting started with virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the current interpreter you are running inside a jupyter notebook use either -\n",

    "Let's start by understanding how a virtual environment is actually physically located in your device. In its most basic form, its simply a folder located on your drive, with all the necessary dependencies, scripts, libraries and most importantly, the `python interpreter`. It's the choice of this python interpreter which decides which python kernel/enviromnent your IDE (jupyter notebook, vscode etc) is running the code on. Simply put, changing the interpreter, changes the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to activate an enviroment to start using it. Once an environment is `active`, it first switches to the relevant interpreter associated with this environment and then, if any `pip install` is run, it only affects this environment and not the others. This is how it isolates your current libraries from your `base` or `default` python enviroment.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT:** *Beware of using `!` shell commands from inside jupyter notebook while using a different kernel / environment. This is because, jupyter uses a hidden shell to run this command without actually activating the environment there. This means `!which python` from inside jupyter notebook will only show default python interpreter. Similarly, `!pip install library`, from inside jupyter notebook, **WILL NOT** install the libary to the current kernel / environment, but will install it for the base environment. Therefore its recommended to use a terminal / powershell with the correct environment activated to run any such shell commands*.\n",
